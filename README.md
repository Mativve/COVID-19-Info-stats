## Idea and creation process
Due to the pandemic and publicly available APIs, I decided to create my application with up-to-date data. In the beginning, there were supposed to be statistics only. At some point I decided to change the way of operation a little and I made the appropriate 'views' thanks to which instead of one huge page we have separate statistics, a single country and an information page.

In addition, I added a contrast change (currently without localStorage) and something experimental - eye protection (working only in a light theme)

## Functionality
* Global Statistics
* List of the most infected country
* List of the least infected country
* Statistics for a single country
* Light and dark version
* Country search engine
* Eye protection - experimental

## Technologies
To create the project, I used:
* Bootstrap Grid
* Font awesome
* Fetch polyfill by github
* Data API from thevirustracker.com
* Pixel Map Generator by amCharts
* Chart by Chart.js
* Chart zoom by Chart.js
